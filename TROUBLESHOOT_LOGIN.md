# Troubleshoot Login Issue

Since Firebase authentication is properly enabled, let's debug the issue step by step.

## Step 1: Check Debug Page

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/debug-login
2. This will show you if the authentication methods are properly loaded
3. You should see:
   - signInWithGoogle: function
   - signInWithEmail: function
   - signUpWithEmail: function
   - resetPassword: function
   - signOut: function

## Step 2: Clear Browser Cache Completely

1. **Chrome/Edge**: 
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Select "All time"
   - Check "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"

2. **Firefox**:
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Select "Everything"
   - Check "Cache"
   - Click "Clear Now"

3. **Or try Incognito/Private browsing mode**

## Step 3: Check Browser Console for Errors

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Click "Console" tab
4. Refresh the page
5. Look for any red error messages
6. If you see errors, please share them

## Step 4: Force Refresh

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Press Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) for hard refresh
3. Or press Ctrl+Shift+R

## Step 5: Check Network Tab

1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Look for any failed requests (red entries)

## What You Should See

After clearing cache, you should see this login form:

## If Still Not Working

Please check:
1. What do you see at http://localhost:3000/debug-login ?
2. Any errors in browser console?
3. What exactly do you see on the login page?

The authentication is properly configured in Firebase, so this is likely a browser caching or JavaScript loading issue.
